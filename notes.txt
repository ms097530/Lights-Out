LightsOut
- state
	- hasWon - boolean -> determine whether or not board is shown
	- board - array of booleans -> each element represents a Light and whether
		it should be on or off ( <Light isOn={this.state.board[i][j]} )
- props
	- grid size?

Light
- props	
	- isOn boolean
- method
	- handleClick -> calls this.props.onClick


- determine if board can be solved
	- simulate a number of moves from a blank board
		- if it was blank at the start, it can be made blank by reversing,
		thus it can be solved
		- can have props of lowerBound and upperBound for chance that
		a square is lit up at the start
		- generate a random number between bounds and then take that percent
		of total squares and round to determine how many squares to
		have lit on the board after simulation
